Installing via Chrome Web Store
-------------------------------
This extension is no longer available in the Chrome Web Store due to reasons

Installing Unpacked (best for local development)
------------------------------------------------
1. Clone this repo
2. Run the command from the project root
    npm install
    grunt manifest copy
3. Go to the [Chrome Extension Config page](chrome://extensions/) chrome://extensions/
4. Click the *Load unpacked extension...* button
5. Select the *dist/unpacked* directory inside the project root
6. (Optionally) run
    grunt watch
This will automatically re-run jshint, all unit tests, and rebuild the *dist/unpacked* directory. (note: you will still have to refresh the extension in Chrome to see any changes take effect)

Other useful grunt commands:
- grunt (will build and run all unit tests)
- grunt js-test-server (will start http server hosting test files, allowing you to run tests in your browser at localhost:8981)
